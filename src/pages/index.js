          I graduated UCLA with a Political Science degree in 2018 after having
          interned for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congressman Alan Lowenthal (in
          Washington, DC), the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, and State

          Upon graduating, I worked for Variety Business Intelligence before
          going to General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp. Since then,
          I've been working as a front end developer at Scholly Inc., primarily
          working with React and React Native.{" "}
